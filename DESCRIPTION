Description: A two-step approach to imputing missing data in metabolomics.
    Step 1 uses a random forest classifier to classify missing values as
    either Missing Completely at Random/Missing At Random (MCAR/MAR) or Missing
    Not At Random (MNAR). MCAR/MAR are combined because it is often difficult to
    distinguish these two missing types in metabolomics data. Step 2 imputes the
    missing values based on the classified missing mechanisms, using the
    appropriate imputation algorithms. Imputation algorithms tested and
    available for MCAR/MAR include Bayesian Principal Component Analysis (BPCA),
    Multiple Imputation No-Skip K-Nearest Neighbors (Multi_nsKNN), and
    Random Forest. Imputation algorithms tested and available for MNAR include
    nsKNN and a single imputation approach for imputation of metabolites where
    left-censoring is present.
